# Create Opinionated React App

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)

## How To Use

Install globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g create-opinionated-react-app
$ create-opinionated-react-app
```

if you don't want to install global dependency:

```bash
$ npm install -g npx
$ npx create-opinionated-react-app
```

## Why?

As die-hard react developer I had to use Angular to help out our client and I was surprised how easy it is to bootstrap new Angular application. I can imagine that VueJs is so popular for a similar reason.

Then I realized that React community does not have any standard when it comes to bootstrapping a new application.

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) or [NextJs](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) you say? **How many extra hours do you have to spend installing code quality tools and other libraries before you can actually start working on your project?**

This is beginner friendly and **opinionated** React App Generator.
