# Create Opinionated React App

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png)

## Installation

Run following command:

```bash
$ npx create-opinionated-app
```

Or you can install this library as global dependency:

```bash
$ npm install -g create-opinionated-app
$ create-opinionated-app
```

## What does it do

All of us need Typescript, CSS-in-JS, code quality tools and basic configuration for unit testing. This is strongly opinionated project generator that is built on top of our favourite frameworks.

## Why?

React community does not have any standard when it comes to bootstrapping new applications. 

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) or [NextJs](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) you say? **How many extra hours do you have to spend installing code quality tools and other libraries before you can actually start working on your project?**

This is beginner friendly and **opinionated** React app generator.
